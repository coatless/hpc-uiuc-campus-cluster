# Illinois Campus Cluster (ICC)

The cluster is an invaluable tool for computational research. Within
this repository, you can find presentation resources created by
**[Robin Tu](https://github.com/rtud2)** and 
**[James Balamuta](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com)**
about how to use the [Illinois Campus Cluster (ICC)](https://campuscluster.illinois.edu/). 

Resources were created for a presentation on **December 7th, 2018**
in the PhD Student Seminar Series within the

the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu).
